Ever wondered how many lines of your Ã¼ber new code codebase is? LineCount will tell ya'

Made in cofee... I mean Java

## Roadmap
- [x] Filter out uninmportant files
- [x] Save code reports
- [x] Improve codefile parsing
- [x] Add config with regex for parsing more languages
- [ ] Make the GUI pretty (add padding)
- [ ] Add menu for adding user defined regexes to the config for languages not included
- [ ] Create menu for ignoring files outside gitignore (maybe create a seperate LineCountIgnore file)
- [ ] Add percentages to the project report
